# Examples

All the examples for Remerge can be found here. For the standalone `.js` fies, you can run them with `./node_modules/.bin/babel-node examples/[test].js` (don't forget to `npm install`!)

The rest of the folders (except `standalone`) are larger examples that have been refactored to use Remerge. To run them, `cd` into the directory and `npm install` followed by `npm start`. Those that contain tests have also been rewritten for Remerge, and can be run with `npm test`.

`standalone` is an example of how Remerge can be used as a standalone script. It consists of a plain HTML page that can be viewed with a browser.
