# Examples

All the examples for Remerge can be found here. For the standalone `.js` fies, you can run them with `./node_modules/.bin/babel-node examples/[test].js` (don't forget to `npm install`!)

`todos` was taken from [Redux's examples](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/tree/master/examples/todos) and refactored to use Remerge. To run the example, `cd` into the directory and `npm install` followed by `npm start`. The example also contains tests that have been rewritten for Remerge, and can be run with `npm test`.
