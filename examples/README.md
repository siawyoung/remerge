# Examples

All the examples for Remerge can be found here. For the standalone `.js` fies, you can run them with `./node_modules/.bin/babel-node examples/[test].js` (don't forget to `npm install`!)

The rest of the folders are larger examples that have been refactored to use Remerge. To run them, `cd` into the directory and `npm install` followed by `npm start`. Those that contain tests have also been rewritten for Remerge, and can be run with `npm test`.
